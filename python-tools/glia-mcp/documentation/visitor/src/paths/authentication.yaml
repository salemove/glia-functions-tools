    Creates an authentication request to authenticate the visitor using a specific authentication provider.

    Note that in addition to this REST API endpoint, there is an authentication request message that can be used to request authentication from a bot and the Visitor JS SDK has a method `createAuthenticationRequest` to request authentication from visitor side.

    See:
      * [Authentication request message](doc:authentication-request)
      * [`createAuthenticationRequest`](https://sdk-docs.glia.com/visitor-js-api/current/Salemove.html#createAuthenticationRequest)
  # yamllint enable rule:line-length
  requestBody:
    $ref: '../requests/authentication.yaml#/create_body'
  responses:
    $ref: '../responses/authentication.yaml#/success'

# Classical delete actions do not have requestBody, thus gives a semantic error
