      Operator position.


      Operators with the highest position (1) are considered first and operators with the lowest position (10) are considered last when assigning an engagement request.


      If `null` is set, the operator position will be removed and not included in the collection anymore.


      Operators with position 10 and no position are treated as having the same position.
