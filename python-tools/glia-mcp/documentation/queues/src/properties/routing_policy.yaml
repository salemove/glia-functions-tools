description: >
  A collection of properties which determine whether visitor should be put into this queue when enqueued and whether
  operator can serve visitors from this queue.


  Note, that one visitor may be put into multiple queues at once, based on queue routing policy and visitor's
  attributes.


  When an empty object is given, all enqueueing visitors will be put into created queue.
properties:
  media:
    description: >
      Set of allowed engagement media types.


      When this routing policy is applied to a queue, visitors who request engagement with insufficient media level,
      won't be placed into the queue.


      Example 1: A queue has `routing_policy.media = ["text"]`, visitor requests engagement with media type `audio`.
      Because queue doesn't have audio in the list of allowed media types, such visitor can't be put into the queue.


      Example 2: A queue has `routing_policy.media = ["text", "phone", "audio"]`, visitor requests engagement with media
      type `audio`. In this case visitor can be put into the queue, because the queue allowed media types includes
      audio.

  team_ids:
    description: >
      The allowed team IDs.


      Must be a set of strings, where each element is a team ID (in UUID v4 format).


      This routing policy allows visitors to be put into the queue only if they are assigned to at least one team from
      the specified list. Similarly, only operators who belong to at least one team from the specified list can serve
      visitors from the queue.
