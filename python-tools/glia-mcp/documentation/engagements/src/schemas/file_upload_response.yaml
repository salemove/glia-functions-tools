      If the value of this field is `true`, the uploader must wait for the [FileSecurityScanResultEvent](https://docs.glia.com/glia-dev/reference/webhooks#filesecurityscanresultevent)
      to arrive before they can send the file as a part of a chat message.
      Additionally, the scan result must be clean in order to send the file.
    example: true
