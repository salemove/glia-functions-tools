      * Attachment type must be `ssml`.

      * Sender must be an operator with audio source `tts_stt`.


      Note that if a chat message contains an attachment of this type, then the `content` parameter of the chat message
      is replaced by the `content` of the attachment with markup tags removed. This will be contained in chat history.
