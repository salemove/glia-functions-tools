      Action to be performed on the engagement participant.


      Available actions:


      ** `hold` ** - Puts the participant call on hold.


      ** `resume` ** - Resumes the participant call.


      ** `remove_audio` ** - Disconnects participant's audio.


      This action can only be performed on primary participants of the engagements - the host operator and visitor.
      Every participant can remove their own audio. In addition, host operator can modify any of the participants.


      Host operator can use this action to downgrade engagement to chat when visitor does not answer the call and the
      call goes to voicemail.


      ** `remove_video` ** - Disconnects participant's video.


      The same constraints and access restrictions apply as for `remove_audio`.
    enum:
      - hold
      - resume
      - remove_audio
      - remove_video
  participant_id:
